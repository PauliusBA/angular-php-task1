# Project Title

Frontend & backend of Job application#

## What was done in projects

UI created with Angular CLI/bootstrap.
Login/register component are set up with a jwt token, although I could not solve the localhost:frontent>localhost:backend>mySql(AWS) 
communication issue. Could not not connect them succesfully and succeed with this functionality.

Job post component also doesnt work with aws. Tried to set the job post to work on localstorage just for the sake of functionality
but ran into "(click)add(title, content)" issue, as I couldn't print them properly and store in localstorage.
